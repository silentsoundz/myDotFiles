Similar to `style-loader`, you can chain it after `css-loader` to dynamically inject CSS into the document as style tags. However, since this is included as a dependency and used by default in `vue-loader`, in most cases you don't need to configure this loader yourself.\r\n\r\n### Differences from `style-loader`\r\n\r\n#### Server-Side Rendering Support\r\n\r\nWhen bundling with `target: 'node'`, the styles in all rendered components are collected and exposed on the Vue render context object as `context.styles`, which you can simply inline into your markup's `<head>`. If you are building a Vue SSR app, you probably should use this loader for CSS imported from JavaScript files too.\r\n\r\n#### Misc\r\n\r\n- Does not support url mode and reference counting mode. Also removed `singleton` and `insertAt` query options. It always automatically pick the style insertion mechanism that makes most sense. If you need these capabilities you should probably use the original `style-loader` instead.\r\n\r\n- Fixed the issue that root-relative URLs are interpreted against chrome:// urls and make source map URLs work for injected `<style>` tags in Chrome.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-style-loader/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-style-loader#readme","_id":"vue-style-loader@2.0.3","_shasum":"b464ffb6279702d4137a80ac81b5c12ac440f0a0","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/vue-style-loader/-/vue-style-loader-2.0.3.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/vue-style-loader/-/vue-style-loader-2.0.3.tgz"}
