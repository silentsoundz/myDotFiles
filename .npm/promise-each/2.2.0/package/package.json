Waits for promises to resolve before\nproceeding to the next value.\n\n## Installation\n```bash\n$ npm install promise-each\n```\n\n## Usage\n```js\nconst each = require('promise-each')\n\nPromise.resolve([1, 2, 3])\n  .then(each((val) => console.log(val)))\n// => 1\n// => 2\n// => 3\n```\n\n## Why?\nThis module is basically equivalent to [`bluebird.each`][bluebird], but it's\nhandy to have the one function you need instead of a kitchen sink. Modularity!\nEspecially handy if you're serving to the browser and need to reduce your\njavascript bundle size.\n\nWorks great in the browser with\n[browserify](http://github.com/substack/node-browserify)!\n\n## See Also\n- [promise-every](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-every)\n- [promise-filter](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-filter)\n- [promise-map](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-map)\n- [promise-reduce](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-reduce)\n- [promise-some](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-some)\n\n## License\n[MIT](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license)\n\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/promise-each.svg?style=flat-square\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/promise-each\n[travis-image]: https://img.shields.io/travis/yoshuawuyts/promise-each.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/yoshuawuyts/promise-each\n[coveralls-image]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/yoshuawuyts/promise-each.svg?style=flat-square\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/yoshuawuyts/promise-each?branch=master\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/promise-each.svg?style=flat-square\n[downloads-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/promise-each\n\n[mdn]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/each\n[promise]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\n[bluebird]: https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/API.md#eachfunction-iterator---promise\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-each/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-each#readme","_id":"promise-each@2.2.0","_shasum":"3353174eff2694481037e04e01f77aa0fb6d1b60","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/promise-each/-/promise-each-2.2.0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/promise-each/-/promise-each-2.2.0.tgz"}
