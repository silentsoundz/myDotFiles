Thus, the main AST must already have the ASTs of the included and extended files embedded in the `FileReference` nodes. `pug-load` is designed to do that.\n\n## License\n\n  MIT\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/pugjs/pug-linker/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/pugjs/pug-linker#readme","_id":"pug-linker@2.0.2","_shasum":"1deca67d741fab46b028c1366f178fbaee620233","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/pug-linker/-/pug-linker-2.0.2.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/pug-linker/-/pug-linker-2.0.2.tgz"}
