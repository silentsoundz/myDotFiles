Realize what's *really* inside your bundle\n2. Find out what modules make up the most of it's size\n3. Find modules that got there by mistake\n4. Optimize it!\n\nAnd the best thing is it supports minified bundles! It parses them to get real size of bundled modules.\nAnd it also shows their gzipped sizes!\n\n## Installation and usage\nThere are two ways to use this module:\n\n### As plugin\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer\n```\n\nIn `webpack.config.js`:\n```js\nvar BundleAnalyzerPlugin = require('webpack-bundle-analyzer').BundleAnalyzerPlugin;\n\n// ...\nplugins: [new BundleAnalyzerPlugin()]\n// ...\n```\n\n`BundleAnalyzerPlugin` constructor can take an optional configuration object that defaults to this:\n\n```js\nnew BundleAnalyzerPlugin({\n  // Can be `server`, `static` or `disabled`.\n  // In `server` mode analyzer will start HTTP server to show bundle report.\n  // In `static` mode single HTML file with bundle report will be generated.\n  // In `disabled` mode you can use this plugin to just generate Webpack Stats JSON file by setting `generateStatsFile` to `true`.\n  analyzerMode: 'server',\n  // Host that will be used in `server` mode to start HTTP server.\n  analyzerHost: '127.0.0.1',\n  // Port that will be used in `server` mode to start HTTP server.\n  analyzerPort: 8888,\n  // Path to bundle report file that will be generated in `static` mode.\n  // Relative to bundles output directory.\n  reportFilename: 'report.html',\n  // Automatically open report in default browser\n  openAnalyzer: true,\n  // If `true`, Webpack Stats JSON file will be generated in bundles output directory\n  generateStatsFile: false,\n  // Name of Webpack Stats JSON file that will be generated if `generateStatsFile` is `true`.\n  // Relative to bundles output directory.\n  statsFilename: 'stats.json',\n  // Options for `stats.toJson()` method.\n  // For example you can exclude sources of your modules from stats file with `source: false` option.\n  // See more options here: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/webpack-1/lib/Stats.js#L21\n  statsOptions: null,\n  // Log level. Can be 'info', 'warn', 'error' or 'silent'.\n  logLevel: 'info'\n})\n```\n\n### As CLI utility\nYou can also analyze already existing bundles if you have Webpack Stats JSON file.\n\nYou can generate it using `BundleAnalyzerPlugin` with `generateStatsFile` option set to `true` or with this simple\ncommand: `webpack --profile --json > stats.json`\n\n`webpack-bundle-analyzer --help` will show you all usage information.\n\n## Contributing\n\nCheck out [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on contributing :tada:\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n\n[downloads-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/webpack-bundle-analyzer.svg\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack-bundle-analyzer.svg\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"webpack-bundle-analyzer@2.3.1","_shasum":"d97f8aadbcce68fc865c5787741d8549359a25cd","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack-bundle-analyzer/-/webpack-bundle-analyzer-2.3.1.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack-bundle-analyzer/-/webpack-bundle-analyzer-2.3.1.tgz"}
