(To learn more about Grunt targets, check out [the Grunt documentation](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#task-configuration-and-targets).)\n\n## Functions\n\n### gulp-grunt()\n__Takes__ `(gulp, options)`\n\nConfiguration is done with the function call:\n```js\nrequire('gulp-grunt')(gulp, {\n  base: ...,\n  prefix: ...\n});\n```\nThis function appends all the grunt tasks it has found to your gulp object as normal gulp tasks.\n\n#### gulp\nYour gulp object that you imported with the code:\n```js\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\n```\nPass it in and gulp-grunt will add all the tasks.\n\n#### options\n`options` is the configuration object you pass in.\n\n#### options.base\nThis tells grunt where to look for your gruntfile.\nSet it to some absolute path.\nThis may require you to use `path.join` for relative paths:\n```js\nrequire('gulp-grunt')(gulp, {\n  base: require('path').join(__dirname, 'yourrelativepathhere')\n});\n```\n\n#### options.prefix\nThis tells gulp-grunt how to prefix your tasks.\nFor instance, if in the gruntfile you define the tasks 'minify' and 'compile',\nand if you pass gulp-grunt this configuration:\n```js\nrequire('gulp-grunt')(gulp, {\n  prefix: 'theknightswhosay-'\n})\n```\nThe grunt tasks can be called from gulp, except they would have the prefix, so\n'theknightswhosay-minify' and 'theknightswhosay-compile'.\n\nYou can simply pass in an empty string(`''`) if you wish to have no prefix.\n\n#### options.verbose\nIf this option is enabled(true), then gulp-grunt will tell you when it starts running a Grunt task or stops it.\nThis option is mainly for debugging.\n\n#### options.force\nIf this option set to `true`, grunt task will never fail, but just give you a warning instead.\n\n#### default options\n\n```js\n{\n  base: null, // this is just the directory that your Gulpfile is in\n  prefix: 'grunt-',\n  verbose: false,\n  force: true\n}\n```\n\n### gulp-grunt.tasks()\n__Takes__ `(options)`\n\nThis just returns all the grunt tasks found, along with their associated functions.\nCalling is essentially the same as with the main function:\n```js\nvar gulp_grunt = require('gulp-grunt')\nvar tasks = gulp_grunt.tasks({\n  base: ...,\n  prefix: ...\n});\n```\nOutput is something like:\n```js\n{\n  'grunt-test': [Function],\n  'grunt-minify': [Function]\n  // etc...\n}\n```\n\n#### options\nThis object is the exact same as for [gulp-grunt()](#gulp-grunt-1) above.\nThis tells gulp-grunt what prefix to use and what base to search for, among other things.\n\n***\n\nHave fun grunting and gulping! :D\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gratimax/gulp-grunt/issues"},"_id":"gulp-grunt@0.5.5","_shasum":"a06692df0d0da1c30cee01f340bbc17ce6947577","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/gulp-grunt/-/gulp-grunt-0.5.5.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/gulp-grunt/-/gulp-grunt-0.5.5.tgz"}
