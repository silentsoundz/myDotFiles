These can be mixed and matched with normal module paths:\n\n```css\n@import \"suitcss-utils-display\"; /* node_modules */\n@import \"./theme.css\"; /* relative path */\n@import \"./components/*.css\"; /* glob */\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThis plugin is a [postcss-import] extension which introduces its own `resolve` option.\n\n### `prefix`\n\nType: `false` or `string`\nDefault: `false`\n\nAllows partial-like importing with a prefix before the filename.\n\n```css\n@import 'modules/partial.css';\n/* will import modules/_partial.css */\n```\n\nPrefixed versions are always favoured. Otherwise the non-prefix version is used:\n\n```\n├── _baz.css\n├── baz.css\n├── bar.css\n```\n\nThe matched files would be `['_baz.css', 'bar.css']`.\n\n### `extensions`\n\nType: `array` or `string`\nDefault: `.css`\n\nDefines file extensions which will be looked for.\n\n# License\n\nMIT © [Bogdan Chadkin](mailto:trysound@yandex.ru)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"postcss-easy-import@2.0.0","_shasum":"a874d4de054b9242545bf553e438c1823c108512","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/postcss-easy-import/-/postcss-easy-import-2.0.0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/postcss-easy-import/-/postcss-easy-import-2.0.0.tgz"}
